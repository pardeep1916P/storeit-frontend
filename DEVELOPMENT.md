# Development Status

## ✅ **Current Status: Working in Development Mode**

The frontend is now running successfully in **development mode** without requiring AWS configuration.

### **What's Working:**

1. **Authentication**: Mock authentication system
2. **File Management**: Mock file operations
3. **Dashboard**: Shows mock data and files
4. **UI Components**: All components working properly
5. **No Appwrite Dependencies**: Completely removed

### **Development Mode Features:**

- **Mock User**: Automatically creates a development user
- **Mock Files**: Shows sample files in the dashboard
- **Mock Storage**: Displays storage usage with sample data
- **File Operations**: Upload, delete, rename (mock operations)

### **How to Test:**

1. **Access the App**: Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Sign In**: Use any email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. **Dashboard**: You'll see mock files and storage data
4. **File Operations**: Try uploading, deleting, or renaming files

### **Next Steps for Production:**

1. **Set up AWS Services**:
   - Create Cognito User Pool
   - Create DynamoDB table
   - Create S3 bucket
   - Deploy Lambda functions

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_ID=your-cognito-user-pool-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=your-cognito-client-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
   ```

3. **Switch to Production Mode**:
   - Once AWS is configured, the app will automatically use real AWS services
   - Development mode is disabled when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL` is set

### **Current Architecture:**

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Development Mode → Mock Data
                    ↓
                Production Mode → AWS Services
```

### **Files Updated:**

- ✅ `user.actions.ts` - Development mode authentication
- ✅ `file.actions.ts` - Development mode file operations
- ✅ `OTPModal.tsx` - Updated for AWS
- ✅ All components - Removed Appwrite dependencies

The application is now ready for development and testing! 🚀
