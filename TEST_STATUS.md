# Frontend Test Status

## ✅ **Current Status: Fixed and Running**

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Wrong Directory Issue**: 
   - The server was running from the root directory instead of `frontend/`
   - Fixed by stopping the server and restarting from `frontend/` directory

2. **Missing Root Page**: 
   - Created `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to handle the `/` route
   - This was causing 404 errors

3. **Development Mode**: 
   - The app now runs in development mode without AWS configuration
   - Mock authentication and file operations work

### **Current Setup:**

- **Server Location**: `frontend/` directory
- **Port**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Mode**: Development (mock data)
- **Authentication**: Mock user system
- **Files**: Mock file operations

### **How to Test:**

1. **Access**: Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Sign In**: Use any email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. **Dashboard**: Should show mock files and storage data
4. **Features**: Upload, delete, rename files (mock operations)

### **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ No more "No session" errors
- ✅ No more 404 errors  
- ✅ Dashboard loads with mock data
- ✅ File operations work (mock)
- ✅ Clean UI design

The frontend should now be working properly! 🚀
